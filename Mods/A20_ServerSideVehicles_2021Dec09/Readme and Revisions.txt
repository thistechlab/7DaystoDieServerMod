A20 Server Side Vehicles - 9th of December 2021
-----------------------------------------------

==========
BACKGROUND
==========
Modder Snufkin introduced an innovative technique to ornate existing vehicles with attachment models to give them a unique appearance.
In many cases, it went so far as to create new vehicles with experimental features and was released in a pack as Snufkin's Custom Vehicles Mod.
This was followed with a Community version which added more additions on top.

A20 saw numerous updates to the vehicle code, which limits conversion of many A19 vehicles from the previous server side only releases.
However, this A20 release can still combine some of the more popular vehicles from A19. 

Apart from periodic issues with flying stability, and the noticeable lighting from hidden vanilla models on two of the vehicles, this selective few offers a highly functional mix.
The current vehicle list, which is typically restricted by access to vanilla vehicles for their recipes, can be produced on the workbench.

Motorcycles:
Hell Beast (Snufkin)
Hell Fire (oakraven)
Hell Dog (oakraven)

Cars, Jeeps, Trucks, and Buses:
Hell Hound (oakraven)
Hell Spikey (oakraven)
Hell Car (Oakraven)

Flyers:
Whirligig (arramus / utilising Bdubyah's MD 500 helicopter settings)
Shark Blimp (oakraven)

Bicycle Base:
Sled (Snufkin)

============
INSTALLATION
============
For Players and Server Admin/Hosts who have never installed a mod before, here are some simple step by step instructions:

1. If you've never installed a mod before, it is necessary to create a mod folder in the main directory, typically (\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die).
If you have a custom install or your server host has modified the installation location, then you may have to explore.

2. Simply make a new folder called Mods (with a capital M to reflect standard nomenclature) in your '7 Days To Die' main directory folder.

3. You can now drag the mod folder directly out of the zipped file and it can be placed directly into the Mods folder. However, there may be a top folder which you do not need. You are looking for a folder that contains a 'ModInfo' file. The folder holding that file will be the one you add to your Mods folder. If you add a folder above that nesting then the game will not be able to see the mod. The top layer will be a single folder and in the second layer you will see a ModInfo.xml file with or without additional folders depending on the mod. Clear instructions on this stage are not possible due to different types of unzip application and their methods. However, this will become elementary once you've launched a few mods.

Does this Mod need to be installed in the server/client host? = YES
Do players also need to install this Mod? = NO

The magic of this mod is that is only needs to be installed in the server/person who has launched the main environment that others join. Enjoy.
